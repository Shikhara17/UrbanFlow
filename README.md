# UrbanFlow

## Introduction
**UrbanSense** is a sophisticated traffic management system designed to optimize vehicle and pedestrian flow at four-way intersections. The system ensures safety and efficiency by utilizing synchronized traffic signals, strategically designed to manage traffic dynamics and minimize conflicts and potential accidents.

## Key Features
- **Synchronized Traffic Signals**: Implements a coordinated system that handles traffic flows for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, ensuring smooth transitions between different phases.
- **Safety Enhancements**: Designed with safety as a priority, featuring distinct signal phases for each direction to effectively prevent conflicts and accidents.
- **Dynamic Traffic Management**: Adapts to real-time traffic conditions to optimize the flow and reduce waiting times at intersections.

## Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**: Utilizes an advanced MCU for real-time signal processing and control.
- **Sensors**: Employs traffic and pedestrian sensors to detect and adapt to varying traffic conditions.
- **Software Simulation Tools**: Uses traffic simulation software for initial testing and adjustments before deployment.

## System Architecture
UrbanSense integrates several components to ensure effective traffic management:
- **Control System**: Centralized control system that processes data from various sensors and dictates the signal phases.
- **Sensor Network**: A network of traffic and pedestrian sensors that provide real-time data to the control system.
- **Signal Synchronization**: Algorithms designed to synchronize signals based on the real-time traffic data, enhancing traffic flow and safety.

## Installation
To deploy UrbanSense at an intersection, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shikhara17/UrbanFlow.git
   cd urbansense
